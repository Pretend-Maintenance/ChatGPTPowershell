# ChatGPTPowershell

Yes, here is a sample PowerShell script that uses the winget command to update all installed apps, and then creates a scheduled task to run the script on a weekly basis at noon.

You will need to replace C:\path\to\script.ps1 with the actual path to the script on your system, and adjust the scheduled time as needed.

It's important to note that you need to be running the script with administrative privileges. If you're running the script in an elevated PowerShell session, you should be good to go. Otherwise, you may need to run the script using the -Verb RunAs argument, like this: powershell.exe -Verb RunAs -File C:\path\to\script.ps1
